Hey! Welcome to my site, <b>riyu.ca</b>! I made this site with three intentions. <br/>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to build some form of a project/portfolio site that compliments my CV.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted a place that could freely create blog-posts nobody would read.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt it was a bit disingenuous that I could not read a lick of JS. So the best solution  to this problem was to get my hands dirty with it.</li>
</ol>
I decided to use Gatsby to build the site. Gatsby is a react-based framework that helps
optimize the usual site building process. My last website, which had its html written entirely by
hand with a little bootstrap was much harder to maintain and extend. If I was going to do this
again, I was certainly going to make sure the website had some dynamic page generating functionality.
<br/>
I experimented with static blog generators like Hexo and Hugo, but it was more difficult
to achieve the customization I was looking for. The blog portion of my site was meant to take
a back seat and portfolio center stage.
<br/>
I settled on Gatsby. It was recommended to me by a friend, it generates the website as static files which are quick and easy to host with Netlify all for the price of $0. Nice!

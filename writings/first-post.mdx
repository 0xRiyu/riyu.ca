Welcome to my journal -- this is where it all started folks!
</p>
<p>
I have always wanted to find my voice online and feel more comfortable sitting down and writing my thoughts. However, I would often have difficulties making that happen on common social networks like twitter -- I am really a reclused person.
</p>

<p>
Creating this website was a two-fold effort to showcase some of the visual aspects of my hobby work, and to create a space online that I can write about the things I discover or find useful.

All my writing is done in react-markdown. I have no idea if this is an optimal way of writing blogposts, but its handy to integrate some things like images into the blog.

Lets see how things pan out with my grand aspirations.

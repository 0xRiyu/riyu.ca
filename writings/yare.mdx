### YARE
<hr/>

Yare (or ヤレ) is a 3D Rendering Engine that I created from scratch using C++ and Vulkan.

The scope of Yare is achieve "high-quality" environment rendering. See [Features](#Features) and [Next Steps](#NextSteps)
to learn more about the current and planned capabilities of the engine.<br/>

I'm not a game developer nor a designer, however I enjoy building software that works with GPUs.
I particularily like how we can write graphics code today, and see continual improvements over time,
or write high performance optimizations for the latest hardware architectures available.

Yare is very very far from being feature complete, as I only work on it in my free time
outside of my day job. Its a good test bed for trying new things in C++ and getting better at optimization work.

- Supports loading of .obj meshes, material (texture) mapping, and transformations. <br/>
- Yare also supports skybox rendering, with cube mapped texturing. <br/>
→ <b>FPS Camera</b><br/>
- Accepts keyboard input to navigate around the 3D rendered space<br/>
→ <b>UI Framework</b><br/>
- Yare implements a pipeline for an ImGui interface, populated with debug and control options<br/>
→ <b>Vulkan 1.2</b><br/>
- Yare does all rendering using the latest Vulkan API and SPIR-V shaders.<br/>

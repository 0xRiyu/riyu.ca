            I'm <b>Drew Cornfield</b>, a Canadian software developer, also known
            as <em>Riyu</em> by some of my peers.
            <br />
            <br />I currently develop internal software tools at{" "}
            <a href="https://www.amd.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              AMD
            </a>{" "}
            within the windows core graphics driver team. Most of my work lies
            with GPUs, building and designing systems that improve the workflows
            of other engineers.
            <br />
            Outside of my work, I enjoy building graphics rendering engines
            (most recently with Vulkan), studying Japanese
            („Åù„Çå„ÇèÈõ£„Åó„ÅÑ), reading light novels, and the like.
